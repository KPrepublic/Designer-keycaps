A good offer that you don't want to refuse.

Yes, it is the new design from iNKY Studio, Amore:Red. The team uses the classical colours (Black and red) to express the meaning 'Amore'. 

Love is so complicated, it could be romantic, be scared, be reasonable and unreasonable. It is just like the colour of Red.  And the black is simple but complicated. It is mysterious and elegant.  

Different with the usual black and red keycaps, iNKY team uses grey font instead of  the white font. To give the keycaps more elegant looking. 

This time, iNKY team gives us a good offer that we don't want to refuse.
