# 1st Silent ECO theme by iNKY Studio
Silent Forest is the first design of iNKY's Silent ECO series. 

With the change of the world's climate, the world largest plain West Siberia changes a lot. The forest and animals have to face a big living problem. 

iNKY team is dedicated to appealing against climate damage with their design. 

Keyboard becomes a piece of everyday-use equipment. iNKY decides to bring their design in keycaps so as to spread their concept. 

Good design needs a good keycap, then iNKY and Domikey take hands.
