'Nature has introduced great variety into the landscape, but man has displayed a passion for simplifying it.' 

Here is the 3rd Silent ECO theme by iNKY Studio ---- Silence Desert.

'Dry', 'hot' and 'empty'  are often used when people talk about desert. We are struggled to live in the desert.  Yes, there are many adventures and mysterious stories in the desert.  However, try not forget how the desert extends. With the development of human beings, the natural resources are overused.

In Silent Desert theme, iNKY Studio uses Brown like colour to show the characteristics of desert. Meanwhile, they add a light-through window in the extra MOD keys, which seems like the few camps who are struggled to live in the desert. 

Moreover, iNKY designs a set of novelty with a plastic cover. You can change the sign on the keycap. It is a trick design to show the 'good' side of the desert (adventures and mysterious storise)
