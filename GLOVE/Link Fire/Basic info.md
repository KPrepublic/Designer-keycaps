After [SA APES TIME](https://kprepublic.com/products/gbextras-domikey-x-glove-sa-apes-time-keycaps-abs-doubleshot?_pos=4&_sid=d4ff779f6&_ss=r), GLOVE team and Domikey start a new design project - Link Fire.

'Before the world was formed, there weren't any lives except trees and immortal ancient dragons. No days and nights. However, one day, the unknown fire was burnt under a tree, which divided the world into day and night. Creatures seem to be awakened by the fire, tethering from here and there. ' 

The image blooms into their mind when GLOVE team plays Dark Souls III. Then, Link Fire project starts. 

GLOVE team and Domikey collaborated already two beautiful keycaps in SA profile. They decided to try something new. Cherry profile is a new keycap line of Domikey. Then Link Fire on Cherry profile is coming.
