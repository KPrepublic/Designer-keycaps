Inspired by the classic movie series the planet of the Apes (*Rise of the planet of the apes*, *Dawn of the planet of the apes and War for the planet of the apes*). 

The NO from Caeser is complicated. It is sad, angry, helpless and hopeless etc. As a first intelligent Ape, as an ape that is well-developed with full emotions of human beings, Caeser eventually stands out and tries his best to guide and lead his groups to protect themselves and to live together with humankind. 

It is not just a movie about the conflict between humans and animals, the science of the future, but also about how we live.

GLOVE team takes three colours - black, grey and yellow to reflect what they feel from the movie. Weapons, disobedience and violence become the theme of their APES TIMES keycaps. However, the main theme is anti-war and violence. Caeser's fight is the fight that we have to do for our life as well.
